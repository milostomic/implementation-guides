# Initiating a Netverify transaction

Call the RESTful API POST endpoint **/initiate** with a JSON object containing the properties described below to create a transaction for each user. You will receive a JSON object in the response containing a timestamp, Jumio transaction reference (scan reference), and a URL which you can use to present Netverify to your user.

**HTTP Request Method:** `POST`<br>
**REST URL (US)**: `https://netverify.com/api/v4/initiate`<br>
**REST URL (EU)**: `https://lon.netverify.com/api/v4/initiate`<br>

<br>

## Authentication and encryption
Netverify API calls are protected using [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617). Your Basic Auth credentials are constructed using your API token as the user-id and your API secret as the password. You can view and manage your API token and secret in the Customer Portal under **Settings > API credentials**.
<br>

|⚠️ Never share your API token, API secret, or Basic Auth credentials with *anyone* — not even Jumio Support.
|:----------|

The [TLS Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) is required to securely transmit your data, and we strongly recommend using the latest version. For information on cipher suites supported by Jumio during the TLS handshake see [Supported cipher suites](/netverify/supported-cipher-suites.md).

<br>

## Request headers

The following fields are required in the header section of your request:<br>

`Accept: application/json`<br>
`Content-Type: application/json`<br>
`Content-Length:`  (see [RFC-7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2))<br>
`Authorization:` (see [RFC 7617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617))<br>
`User-Agent: YourCompany YourApp/v1.0`<br>

|ℹ️ Jumio requires the `User-Agent` value to reflect your business or entity name for API troubleshooting.|
|:---|

<br>

## Request body

The body of your **initiate** API request allows you to

- provide your own internal tracking information for the user and transaction.
- specify what user information is captured and by which method.
- indicate where the user should be directed after the user journey.
- select the language to be displayed.
- preset options to enhance the user journey.

|ℹ️ Values set in your API request will override the corresponding settings configured in the Customer Portal.
|:----------|

<sup>2</sup> See URL constraints for [Callback, Error, and Success URLs](#callback-error-and-success-urls).

<br>

## Supported `workflowId` values
Acquisition workflows allow you to set a combination of verification and capture method options.

|⚠️ Identity Verification must be enabled for your account to use an ID + Identity `workflowId`.
|:----------|

|Value |Verification type |Capture method |
|:-----|:-----------------|:--------------|
|100   |ID only           |camera + upload|
|101   |ID only           |camera only    |
|102   |ID only           |upload only    |
|200   |ID + Identity     |camera + upload|
|201   |ID + Identity     |camera only    |
|202   |ID + Identity     |upload only    |

<br>

## Supported `presets` values
It is possible to specify presets for **ID Verification**, for **Identity Verification**, for both together, or for neither. For each preset you use, all values must be passed together as a JSON array (see [Sample request](#sample-request)) for the request to be valid.
<br>

### ID Verification presets

#### Preset country and document type
Preset the country and document type to bypass the selection screen.

**Required items appear in bold type.**

|Name   |Type    |Max. length    |Description    |
|:------------|:-------|:--------------|:--------------|
|**index**|integer|1| must be set to `1`|
|**country**|string|3|Possible values:<br>•	[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) country code <br /> • `XKX` (Kosovo) |
|**type**|string|15|Possible values:<br>• `PASSPORT`<br>•	`DRIVING_LICENSE`<br>•	`ID_CARD`|
<br>

### Identity Verification presets

Identity Verification in Netverify allows you to make sure the person submitting the ID for verification is the same person in the ID photo. This comprises two steps: the **Face Match** step and the optional **Liveness Check** step. The Face Match step allows us to compare the face in the ID photo with the face of the person submitting the transaction for similarity, and the additional Liveness Check ensures that person is present during the transaction.

Identity Verification can be enabled with the Face Match step only or in conjunction with a Liveness Check.

There are currently two options to check for liveness:

* 3D Liveness for Web
* Liveness Detection (with handwritten note)

#### 3D Liveness for Web (no preset available)

Netverify's new 3D face liveness detection technology creates a three-dimensional map of your user's face, providing unprecedented accuracy for the Liveness Check, and creates an enrollment transaction for the use of the Authentication feature.

|ℹ️ To use 3D Liveness, Identity Verification and 3D Liveness must be enabled for your account by Jumio Support.
|:----------|

3D Liveness requires that the user has access to a camera. In order to ensure that 3D Liveness is always used for the Liveness Check, your users must be restricted to using their camera either for the entire transaction, or for the Identity Verification step. This can be accomplished by:

* changing your **Capture method** in the **Settings** area of the [Customer Portal](/netverify/portal-settings.md) to **Webcam only** for the entire transaction.
* including [workflowId 201](#supported-workflowid-values) to specify "ID + Identity, camera only" in the API request when you initate a Netverify transaction.
* asking Jumio Support to enable **Force Camera for Identity** to allow upload of the ID image, but force the user to use a camera for the Identity Verification step.

|capture method|when|result|
|:---|:---|:---|
|upload only|always|user asked to upload selfie
|camera + upload|user uploads ID image|user asked to upload selfie
|camera + upload|camera not available|user asked to upload selfie
|camera + upload|browser not supported|user asked to upload selfie
|camera only|camera not available|error 9820
|camera only|browser not supported|error 9820

<br>

#### Liveness Detection (with handwritten note): preset custom phrase

In order to use this preset, Identity Verification and Liveness Detection (with handwritten note) must be enabled for your account. Jumio Support will ask you to provide a default custom phrase to be submitted by your users on a handwritten note during the Identity Verification process. After the default custom phrase has been configured for your account, this preset can be used to change the phrase for any transaction.

|⚠️Enabling Liveness Detection (with handwritten note) for your account will override all other Identity Verification options.
|:---|
<br>

**Required items appear in bold type.**

|Name   |Type    |Max. length    |Description    |
|:------------|:-------|:--------------|:--------------|
|**index**|integer|1| must be set to `2`|

<sup>1</sup> Values **must not** contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data such as email addresses.

<br>


## Supported `locale` values
Hyphenated combination of [ISO 639-1:2002 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code plus [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country (where applicable).

# Configuring settings in the Customer Portal

In the **Settings** screen of the Customer Portal you can customize your settings and brand your Netverify page. <br>Save changes using your Customer Portal password to activate them.
<br>

|ℹ️ Values set in your API request will override the corresponding settings configured in the Customer Portal.
|:----------|

<br>

## Application settings — General

### Callback, Error, and Success URLs

Define a **Callback URL** to receive verification results and extracted user data from Jumio when a transaction is completed. For more information, see our [Callback](/netverify/callback.md) documentation.

Define a **Success URL** to direct the user after images are accepted for processing. If no **Success URL** is specified in the Customer Portal or the **initiate** API request, the Jumio default success page will be displayed, including any custom [images](#images) you have specified.

Define an **Error URL** to direct the user when the verification process ends with an error or a failure after 3 submission attempts. If no **Error URL** is specified in the Customer Portal or the **initiate** API request, the Jumio default error page will be displayed, including any custom [images](#images) you have specified.



#### URL requirements:

* HTTPS using the [TLS Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) (most recent version recommended)
* Valid [URL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) using [ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or [IDNA Punycode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492)

#### URL restrictions:

* IP addresses, ports, certain query parameters and fragment identifiers are not allowed.
* Personally identifiable information (PII) is not allowed in any form.

Jumio appends the following parameters to your Success or Error URL to redirect your user at the conclusion of the user journey. These cannot be used as part of your Success or Error URL:

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|transactionStatus| • `SUCCESS` for successful submissions. <br> • `ERROR`for errors and failure after 3 attempts.|
|customerInternalReference<sup>1</sup>|Your internal reference for the transaction.|
|transactionReference|Jumio reference number for the transaction.|
|errorCode|Displayed when `transactionStatus` is `ERROR`.|

<sup>1</sup> Values **must not** contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data such as email addresses.
<br>

### Capture method

Specify how your user can submit their ID or Identity image for verification.<br>
<br>
Choose from:

- **Webcam and image upload**
- **Webcam only**
- **Image upload only**



|⚠️ Selecting "Webcam only" means some [mobile browsers](#mobile) will not be supported.
|:----------|

<br>

### Skip "Start ID verification" screen

Select this checkbox to bypass the introductory screen in the Netverify Web client.

<br>

### Authorization token lifetime

Specify the duration of time for which your `redirectUrl` will remain valid. Enter the value in minutes (minimum 5, maximum 86400). The default value is 30 minutes.

<br>

## Application settings — Redirect

### Domain name prefix

You can optionally define a domain name prefix (`https://yourcompany.netverify.com`) for the URL of your Netverify page.


- Allowed characters are letters `a-z`, numbers `0-9`, `-`
- Must not start or end with `-`
- Max. 63 characters

<br>

## Customize client

### Colors

Specify primary and secondary colors for each locale to give Netverify your own look and feel.

Any locale which is not configured will first default to the root language (e.g. EN\_GB to EN), then to your default configuration, and finally to the Jumio default.

You can also reset all colors to the Jumio default.


### Images

Add a **Header image** for each locale to brand your Netverify page.

Add a **Success image** and **Error image** for each locale to be displayed on the Jumio default success and error pages when you do not specify your own [Success URL](#callback-error-and-success-urls) and [Error URL](#callback-error-and-success-urls).

Any locale which is not configured will first default to the root language (e.g. EN\_GB to EN), then to your default configuration, and finally to the Jumio default.

All images must be formatted as [JPG](https://jpeg.org/jpeg/) or [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) and must not exceed 5 MB.

<br>

# Displaying Netverify

The **redirectUrl** returned in the response to your **initate** API call, which loads your customized Netverify page, can be used in several ways:

* within an iFrame on your web page
* as a link on your web page
* as a link shared securely with a user

## Using Netverify in an iFrame
If you want to embed Netverify on a web page, place the iFrame tag in your HTML code where you want the client to appear. Use the `redirectUrl` as value of the `src` attribute.

|⚠️ The `allow="camera"` attribute must be included to enable the camera for image capture in [supported browsers](#supported-browsers).
|:----------|

|⚠️ In case you are nesting the iFrame in another iFrame the `allow="camera"` attribute must be added to every iFrame.
|:----------|

### Width and height
We recommend adhering to the responsive breaking points in the table below.

|Size class |Width|Height|
|:-------|---:|-------:|
|Large|≥ 900 px|≥ 710 px|
|Medium| 640 px|660 px|
|Small|560 px|600 px|
|X-Small|≤ 480 px|≤ 535 px|

Note: When specifying the width and height of your iFrame you may prefer to use percentage values so that the iFrame behaves responsively on your page.

|⚠️The Netverify Web client itself will responsively fill the iFrame that it is loaded into.
|:----------|

### 3D Liveness

For a better user experience when creating a three-dimensional map of your user's face, you must allow full screen mode. This will address the positioning and distance between the capture interface and the camera.

|⚠️ The `allow="camera;fullscreen" allowfullscreen` attributes must be included to enable the camera for image capture in [supported browsers](#supported-browsers) in full screen mode.
|:----------|

### Example HTML

#### Absolute sizing example
```
<iframe src="https://yourcompany.netverify.com/web/v4/app?locale=en-GB&authorizationToken=xxx" width="930" height="750" allow="camera"></iframe>
```

#### Responsive sizing example
```
<iframe src="https://yourcompany.netverify.com/web/v4/app?locale=en-GB&authorizationToken=xxx" width="70%" height="80%" allow="camera"></iframe>
```

#### 3D Liveness example
```
<iframe src="https://yourcompany.netverify.com/web/v4/app?locale=en-GB&authorizationToken=xxx" width="70%" height="80%" allow="camera;fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```


<!---
### Using the Customer Portal - do not display

You can create a transaction manually in the Customer Portal under the "Create verfication" tab. The values you can specify are equal to the related API request parameters described in the previous section of the guide.
--->
<br>



### Optional iFrame logging

When the Netverify client is embedded in an iFrame<sup>1</sup>, it will communicate with the containing page using the JavaScript [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) method to send events containing pre-defined data. This allows the containing page to react to events as they occur (e.g., by directing to a new page once the `success` event is received). Events include data that allows the containing page to identify which Netverify transaction triggered the event. Events are generated in a stateless way, so that each event contains general contextual information about the transaction (e.g., transaction reference, authorization token, etc.) in addition to data about the specific event that occurred.

Using JavaScript, the containing page can receive the notification and consume the data it contains by listening for the `message` event on the global `window` object and reacting to it as needed. The data passed by the Netverify Web client in this notification is represented as JSON in the `data` string property of the listener method's `event` argument. Parsing this JSON string results in an object with the properties described below.

All data is encoded with [UTF-8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629).
<br>
<br>
<sup>1</sup> This functionality is not available for instances of Netverify running in a standalone window or tab.<br>

#### `event.data` object

**Required items appear in bold type.**  

|Property|Type|Description
|:-------|:---|:----------|
|**authorizationToken**|string|Authorization token, valid for a specified duration.|

Make sure that the required permissions are granted.

- `android.permission.INTERNET` - _for remote resources access_
- `android.permission.CAMERA` - _for camera capture_
- `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - _for upload functionality_

The following settings are required for the native WebView for Android.

- Enable [`javaScriptEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setjavascriptenabled) - _tells the WebView to enable JavaScript execution_
- Allow [`allowFileAccess`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setallowfileaccess) - _enables file access within WebView_
- Allow [`allowFileAccessFromFileUrls`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setallowfileaccessfromfileurls) - _sets whether JavaScript running in the context of a file scheme URL should be allowed to access content from other file scheme URLs_
- Allow [`allowUniversalAccessFromFileUrls`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setallowuniversalaccessfromfileurls) - _sets whether JavaScript running in the context of a file scheme URL should be allowed to access content from any origin_
- Allow [`allowContentAccess`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setallowcontentaccess) - _enables content URL access within WebView_
- Allow [`javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setjavascriptcanopenwindowsautomatically) - _tells JavaScript to open windows automatically_
- Enable [`domStorageEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setdomstorageenabled) - _sets whether the DOM storage API is enabled_
- **Do not** allow [`mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setmediaplaybackrequiresusergesture) - _sets whether the WebView requires a user gesture to play media_

#### Embedding required script

To allow Jumio to identify the user runtime environment you will need to interact with the webview window object by embedding a required script. This script sets flag `__NVW_WEBVIEW__` to `true`.

#### Optional postMessage communication

You can handle messages from the Netverify Web Client using the same method as described in [Optional iFrame Logging](#optional-iframe-logging).

You will need to register a postMessage handler and put the relevant code sections in the `PostMessageHandler` class as in the example mentioned below.

#### Sample code

**_AndroidManifest.xml_ example**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        package="com.jumio.nvw4">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    ...
</manifest>
```

**_build.gradle_ example**
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0-beta01'
    implementation 'androidx.webkit:webkit:1.2.0'
    ...
}
```

**_WebViewFragment.kt_ example**
```kotlin
class WebViewFragment : Fragment() {
    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);
​
        webview.settings.javaScriptEnabled = true;

### iOS

The following sections explain the steps needed to embed Netverify Web in a native iOS WebView.

Please also refer to the sample code beneath.

#### Permissions and Settings

No specific permissions are needed as we cannot access the camera due to native WebView limitations for iOS.

#### Embedding required script

To allow Jumio to identify the user runtime environment you will need to interact with the webview window object by embedding a required script. This script sets flag `__NVW_WEBVIEW__` to `true`.

#### Optional postMessage communication

You can handle messages from the Netverify Web Client using the same method as described in [Optional iFrame Logging](#optional-iframe-logging).

Please register a postMessage handler and put the relevant code sections in the `userContentController` function as mentioned below.

#### Sample code

**_ViewController.swift_ example**

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var webView: WKWebView!
​
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        webView.navigationDelegate = self;
​
        /**
         *  Registering handler for postMessage communication (iFrame logging equivalent - optional)
         */
        webView.configuration.userContentController.add(self, name: "__NVW_WEBVIEW_HANDLER__")
​
        webView.load( URLRequest("<<NVW4 SCAN REF LINK>>"));
    }
}
​
extension ViewController: WKNavigationDelegate {
    /**
     *  Embedding script at very beginning, before NVW4 initialize (important)
     */
    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didStartProvisionalNavigation navigation: WKNavigation!) {
        /**
         *  Necesssary integration step - embedding script
         */
        self.webView?.evaluteJavaScript("(function() { window['__NVW_WEBVIEW__'] = true })()") { _, error in
            if let error = error {
                print("ERROR while evalutaing javascript \(error)") // error handling whenever executing script fails
            }
            print("executed injected javascript")
        };
    }
}
​
extension ViewController: WKScriptMessageHandler {
    /**
     *  PostMessage handler for iframe logging equivalent (optional)
     */
    func userContentController(_ userController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {
        if message.name == "__NVW_WEBVIEW_HANDLER__", let messageBody = message.body as? String {
            /*
	*  See iFrame logging:
	*  https://github.com/Jumio/implementation-guides/blob/master/netverify/netverify-web-v4.md#optional-iframe-logging
            */
        }
    }
}
```

## After the user journey

At the end of the user journey, the user is directed to your **Success URL** if the images they submitted were accepted for processing. If no **Success URL** has been defined, the Jumio default success page will be displayed, including any custom success [image](#images) you have specified in the Customer Portal.

If acceptable images are not provided after three attempts (see [Reject reasons](/netverify/callback.md#reject-reason)), the user is directed to your **Error URL**. If no **Error URL** has been defined, the Jumio default error page will be displayed, including any custom error [image](#images) you have specified in the Customer Portal.

To display relevant information on your success or error page, you can use the following parameters which we append when redirecting to your `successUrl` or `errorUrl` as HTTP `GET` query string parameters<sup>1</sup>. It is also possible to set `successUrl` and `errorUrl` to the same address, by using the query parameter `transactionStatus`.<br>

**Required items appear in bold type.**

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**transactionStatus**|Possible values:<br>• `SUCCESS` for successful submissions. <br> • `ERROR`for errors and failure after 3 attempts.|
|**customerInternalReference**<sup>2</sup>|Your internal reference for the transaction.|
|**transactionReference**|Jumio reference number for the transaction.|
|errorCode|Displayed when `transactionStatus` is `ERROR`.<br>Possible values: <br>• `9100` (Error occurred on our server.)<br>• `9200` (Authorization token missing, invalid, or expired.)<br>• `9210` (Session expired after the user journey started.)<br>• `9300` (Error occurred transmitting image to our server.)<br>• `9400` (Error occurred during verification step.)<br>• `9800` (User has no network connection.)<br>• `9801` (Unexpected error occurred in the client.)<br>• `9810` (Problem while communicating with our server.)<br>• `9820` (File upload not enabled and camera unavailable.)<br>• `9821` (The 3D liveness face capture process failed after 3 attempts.)<br>• `9822` (Browser does not support camera.)<br>• `9835` (No acceptable submission in 3 attempts.)|

<sup>1</sup> Because HTTP `GET` parameters can be manipulated on the client side, they may be used for display purposes only.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Values **must not** contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data such as email addresses.

### Sample success redirect

```
https://www.yourcompany.com/success/?transactionStatus=SUCCESS&customerInternalReference=YOUR_REF&transactionReference=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Sample error redirect

```
https://www.yourcompany.com/error/?transactionStatus=ERROR&customerInternalReference=YOUR_REF&transactionReference=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&errorCode=9820
```
