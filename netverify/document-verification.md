# Global Netverify Settings

Configuration settings are located in the Jumio Customer Portal. The description of each of the settings are available via the link below.

[View the Customer Portal settings guide](/netverify/portal-settings.md)

# Authentication and encryption

All Document Verification API calls are protected using [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617). Your Basic Auth credentials are constructed using your API token as the user-id and your API secret as the password. You can view and manage your API token and secret in the Customer Portal under **Settings > API credentials**.
<br>

|⚠️ Never share your API token, API secret, or Basic Auth credentials with *anyone* — not even Jumio Support.
|:----------|

The [TLS Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) is required to securely transmit your data, and we strongly recommend using the latest version. For information on cipher suites supported by Jumio during the TLS handshake see [supported cipher suites](/netverify/supported-cipher-suites.md).

<br>


# Using the Document Verification web client

The Document Verification web client offers document upload and data extraction (see [supported documents](#supported-documents)) with a Jumio-hosted user interface. Use the RESTful API as described below to initiate a transaction and share the resulting URL securely with your user or embed it in an iFrame on your website. You can receive a callback when the transaction is complete containing extracted data (if applicable) and a link to the image uploaded by your user (see [Callback](/netverify/callback.md)).

Uploads are restricted to JPEG, PNG or PDF file types totaling of 10MB in size. Credit card uploads are limited to 2 images or PDF pages, and all other document types are limited to 30 images or PDF pages.

<br>


## Initiating the transaction

Call the RESTful API POST endpoint **/acquisitions** with a JSON object containing the properties described below to create a transaction for each user. You will receive a JSON object in the response containing a Jumio scan reference, and a URL which you can use to present the Document Verification web client to your user.

**HTTP request method:** `POST`<br>
**REST URL (US):** `https://upload.netverify.com/api/netverify/v2/acquisitions`<br>
**REST URL (EU):** `https://upload.lon.netverify.com/api/netverify/v2/acquisitions`<br>

## Response
Unsuccessful requests will return the relevant [HTTP status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) and information about the cause of the error.

Successful requests will return HTTP status code `200 OK` along with a JSON object containing the information described below.

**Required items appear in bold type.**

|Name|Type|Max. length|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:-----------|:------------|
|**scanReference**|string|36|Jumio reference number for the transaction.|
|**clientRedirectUrl**|string|2000|URL used to load the Document Verification client.|

<br>



### Sample response
```
{
"scanReference": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"clientRedirectUrl": "https://upload.netverify.com/api/netverify/v2/acquisitions?initiationToken=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

<br>




## Displaying the Document Verification web client

To display the Document Verification, place the `clientRedirectUrl` into the `src` attribute of an iFrame tag, specifying an appropriate width and height, or use it to create a link on your web page.

We recommend considering the following dimensions:

-	Min. size: 320 x 480 pixels (or 480 x 320 if landscape on mobile)
-	Max. width of 900 pixels (for iFrame only)

<br>


## Redirecting the customer after the user journey

At the end of the user journey, the user is directed to your **Success URL** if the images they submitted were accepted for processing. If no **Success URL** has been defined, the Jumio default success page will be displayed, including any custom success [image](/netverify/portal-settings.md#images) you have specified in the Customer Portal.

In the event of an error, the user is directed to your , the user is directed to your **Error URL**. If no **Error URL** has been defined, the Jumio default error page will be displayed, including any custom error [image](/netverify/portal-settings.md#images) you have specified in the Customer Portal.

To display relevant information on your success or error page, you can use the following parameters which we append when redirecting to your `successUrl` or `errorUrl` as HTTP `GET` query string parameters<sup>1</sup>. It is also possible to set `successUrl` and `errorUrl` to the same address, by using the query parameter `idScanStatus`.<br>

<br>

**Required items appear in bold type.**

Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**idScanStatus**|Possible values:<br>• `SUCCESS` <br> • `ERROR`|
|**jumioIdScanReference**|Jumio reference number for the transaction.|
|errorCode|Displayed when `transactionStatus` is `ERROR`.<br>Possible values: <br>• `211` (authorization token invalid)<br>• `310` (upload session has expired)<br>• `311` (document upload was already completed for provided scan reference)<br>• `320` (browser session has been started multiple times)<br>• `338` (third party cookies are disabled)<br>|
<sup>1</sup> Because HTTP `GET` parameters can be manipulated on the client side, they may be used for display purposes only.
<br>
<br>


### Sample success redirect
```
https://www.yourcompany.com/success?idScanStatus=SUCCESS&jumioIdScanReference=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Sample error redirect
```
https://www.yourcompany.com/error?idScanStatus=ERROR&jumioIdScanReference=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&errorCode=320
```

|BS (bank statement) |name, issueDate, address, accountNumber, swiftCode |
|CC (credit card) |name, pan, expiryDate |

# Deleting transactions

You can delete transactions easily in the Customer Portal.

In **Verifications**, search for the transaction you want to delete. Click the trash can icon to the right of the scan details to remove sensitive data (e.g., name, address, date of birth, document number, etc.) and image(s) from the transaction record.

You can also implement the RESTful DELETE API to remove sensitive data and image(s) from a completed transaction.<br>

[View the Delete API implementation guide](/netverify/netverify-delete-api.md)

When deleting transaction data, the Jumio scan reference and timestamp will be retained for reporting purposes.
