### Callback, Error, and Success URLs

Define a **Callback URL** to automatically receive verification results and extracted user data from Jumio when a transaction is completed.

Define a **Success URL** to direct your customer after a successful user journey.

Define an **Error URL** to direct your customer when the verification process ends with an error or a failed submission attempt.


#### Required:

* HTTPS using the [TLS Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) (most recent version recommended)
